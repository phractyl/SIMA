# SIMA
SIMA is a Python program to scan a selected .txt file for dictionary values and outputs counts, percentages, and associated key-pairings.  Users simply define their own dictionary keys and values.

Originally, __SIMA__, (*S*yllabus *I*nvestigation *MAchine*) was used to investigate nearly 600 syllabi across ten departments for specific language choices that were defined in a dictionary split by key:value pairs. The keys used were four communucative "values" from a curriculum revision initiative, and the values were populated by using the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA)'s terrific thesaural search function. It is also named in honor of the programmer's screen name (ScreamingIsMyAir) who helped "unstick" a particularly challenging print output. 

It is a very flexible program, as users must define their own key:value pairs for whatever analysis they wish to use. I recommended using COCA, but you can use any corpus with thesaural search functions.
